+ resizing -- i added the code, the case seem to never execute;
i have no clue why, and not being able to create debug builds is not helping,
this will have to wait until gcc gets fixed
+ unicode support in the tui
+ when i can be bothered to do so, histui should support multiple shells
    * obvious stuff, such as creating a separete scanner for each shell
    * display the shell in the tui
+ configurable entry format strings?
+ inline syntax highlighting
